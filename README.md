# P2P-Carpooling-DAPP

An alternative cab booking app to apps like Ola, and Uber, which control the working environment for drivers and take a cut from their earnings as commission making life difficult for a regular driver. This P2P Carpooling DAPP will connect drivers directly with customers to share a ride. The transactions will go through on blockchain with the help of smart contracts paid via cryptocurrency. Anyone can register as a driver and publish rides for people to book. Not only does this make the process more hassle-free, but makes it more transparent.
