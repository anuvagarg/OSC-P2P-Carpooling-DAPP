# P2P-Carpooling-DAPP


An alternative to apps like Ola, Uber, who control the working environment
for drivers and take a cut from their earnings which makes life
difficult for a normal driver. This P2P Carpooling DAPP will connect
drivers directly with customers to share a ride. The transactions
will go through on blockchain with the help of smart contracts and
will be paid for via cryptocurrency. Anyone can register as a driver
and publish rides for people to book.
